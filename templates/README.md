### Data Guidelines

1. **Dates**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for all dates
2. **Monetary Values**: Enter as whole numbers without currency symbols or commas
3. **Instrument Types**: Use exact spelling as shown in examples
4. **Numerical Values**: Use whole numbers for counts, decimals allowed for ages
5. **Missing Values**: Leave empty if unknown (don't use 0 unless it's actually zero)

### Example Record
```csv
CL001,CNT2023001,2023-01-01,2023-12-31,INST001,mass_spectrometer,3.5,25000,8,4,6,3500,24,4,4,1,8500
```

This record shows:
- Client CL001 has a contract (CNT2023001) for the year 2023
- They have a mass spectrometer (INST001) that is 3.5 years old
- Contract revenue is $25,000
- Had 8 phone consultations and 4 onsite visits
- Spent 6 days onsite and 24 hours on repairs
- Parts cost $3,500
- All 4 scheduled PM visits were completed
- Had 1 client error
- Total repair cost was $8,500

### Data Collection Best Practices

1. **Consistency**: Use the same format for each record
2. **Completeness**: Try to fill all fields when possible
3. **Accuracy**: Double-check numerical values and dates
4. **Updates**: Update records as new information becomes available
5. **Validation**: Ensure:
   - Dates are valid
   - PM visits completed â‰¤ PM visits scheduled
   - Total repair cost includes parts cost
   - Contract dates are logical (end date after start date)
